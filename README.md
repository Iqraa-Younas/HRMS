# HRMS
Human Resource Management System
It includes UML Diagrams for HRMS. 
An HRMS (Human Resource Management System) is a type of HR software that enables the management of several HR functions through information technology. The organization for which the system is being developed is currently managing the data and other details manually. However, as the organization is growing rapidly, more people are becoming a part of it, transforming it into a large-scale organization. To support HR, some electronic-based HRMS is required. The system aims to improve the productivity and efficiency of the business through the automation of manual and repetitive tasks. This, in turn, also frees up the HR teamâ€™s time which can then be used to address more strategic, business-critical tasks. General Objective is to provide a system that gives an ease access to manage staff, development, students and Instructors. The system automates payroll, attendance management, leave management, employee information, Employee Hiring, Resignation, termination, schedule management and access control. The centralized database contains all the present and historic information about active and non-active employees of the organization. It is a single source for flawless employee administration, management, registration and all crucial employee-related information. This HRMS does not include modules such as appraisal form management and online recruitment.
